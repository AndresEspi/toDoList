## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
### Setup

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

### Prerequisites

- **code editor(I recommend Visual Studio Code )**
- **Git**
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to edit the code**
- **Browser to run the website**

### Install

Open a command line or terminal on your machine.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. You can use the cd command followed by the directory path.

Run the following command to clone the repository:

- **git clone https://github.com/AndresEspi/toDoList .**

This command will create a new directory called "animePage" and download the files from the repository into it.

### Usage

Once you've cloned the repository, you can open it in your code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to make any necessary adaptations.

To run the project, you must follow the instructions provided in the project documentation or README file. Usually, a specific command will be specified to start the project. For example, if the project uses a local web server, you can run the following command:

- **npm start**

Asegúrate de cumplir con todos los requisitos previos y dependencias antes de ejecutar el proyecto.


### Run test

Make sure you meet all the prerequisites and dependencies before running the project.

- **npm test**

This command will run the tests defined in the project and display the results in the terminal. Make sure all test dependencies are installed before running this command.  

### Deployment

The deployment of the project will depend on your needs and the implementation platform you want to use. Here are some general steps for deployment:

- Make sure you meet the project-specific requirements and configurations for the production environment.
- Choose a deployment platform or hosting service that fits your needs (for example, Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).
- Follow the documentation or guides of the selected platform to implement your project. This may involve creating a new app or project, configuring deployment settings, and uploading the project files.
- Run extensive tests in the production environment to make sure everything works correctly.
- Once you're happy with the deployment, you can share the deployed project by providing the deployment URL or making it publicly accessible as needed.
